# Ricardo Plansky's Blog

### Objective
It's just a simple repository to keep posts of [rplansky.com](http://rplansky.com),
to make some drafts and use
[Issues](https://www.github.com/rplansky/rplansky-blog-posts/issues) to receive
some suggestions about what I should write.

### Suggestions
Just open an [issue](https://www.github.com/rplansky/rplansky-blog-posts/issues)
and we can discuss about that
